Project 0 Coders Coffee House

What is it?
It is a website that advertises a coffee shop for people who are constantly working on their laptops or computer. It provides a safe space for people to complete their work around like-minded individuals. 

Why should I make it?
I am making it so that hardworking individuals have a social place to work around like minded individuals. A place that is away from work or home and motivated them to concentrate on their tasks.

Who is my target audience. 
People who code, Web developers, app makers. Anyone who uses their computer to make a living. It will provide a social place for groups and individuals alike. It will also gove them peace of mind that their laptops will never run out of battery as every tabel will have its own power source.
